## 📖 About The Project

**SnackoGram** is a reel-based social platform designed specifically for food lovers. We leverage a clean, distraction-free UI to let the food shine.

The platform serves two main ecosystems:
1.  **Users (Foodies):** Can scroll through mouth-watering food reels and instantly visit the profile/store of the creator.
2.  **Food Partners:** Can upload engaging reels to showcase their menu and drive traffic to their store pages.

Built with the **MERN Stack** and powered by **ImageKit** for high-performance video streaming.
